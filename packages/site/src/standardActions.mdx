# Standard Actions

In order to work over object and arrays without requiring declaring custom actions you can use the already predefined `objectActions` and `arrayActions` (note these also work over class models).

`objectActions` work over any kind of objects (including model themselves) and offer:

- `set(obj, key, value)` to set a key.
- `delete(obj, key)` to delete a key.
- `assign(obj, partialObj)` to assign values (similar to `Object.assign`).
- `call(methodName, ...args)` to call a method.

`arrayActions` work over arrays and offer:

- `set(array, index, value)` to set an index.
- `delete(array, index)` to delete an index.
- `setLength(array, length)` to set a new length.

Plus the usual array mutation methods (`pop`, `push`, etc.).
