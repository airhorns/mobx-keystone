# Standalone Actions

Sometimes you might need to define a "model" action but without an associated model. Say for example that you need an array swap method that needs the be processed by middlewares (undoable, etc.). One way to achieve this is to use standalone actions like this:

```ts
const arraySwap = standaloneAction(
  "myApp/arraySwap",
  <T>(array: T[], index1: number, index2: number): void => {
    const [v1, v2] = [array[index1], array[index2]]
    array[index2] = v1
    array[index1] = v2
  }
)
```

Note the following pre-requisites apply to standalone actions:

- The name provided must be unique across your whole application.
- The first argument (the target) must always be an existing tree node.

# Standard Actions

In order to work over object and arrays without requiring declaring custom actions you can use the already predefined `objectActions` and `arrayActions` (note these also work over class models).

`objectActions` work over any kind of objects (including model themselves) and offer:

- `set(obj, key, value)` to set a key.
- `delete(obj, key)` to delete a key.
- `assign(obj, partialObj)` to assign values (similar to `Object.assign`).
- `call(methodName, ...args)` to call a method.

`arrayActions` work over arrays and offer:

- `set(array, index, value)` to set an index.
- `delete(array, index)` to delete an index.
- `setLength(array, length)` to set a new length.

Plus the usual array mutation methods (`pop`, `push`, etc.).
